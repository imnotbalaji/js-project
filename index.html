          <h2>Calm Money: A simple stock visualizer </h2>
          <br>
          <p><b>Motivation: </b> UX of almost all stock apps is meant for a pro user 100s of indicators, multiple charts! We start with the philosophy that a beginner wants simplicity and focus - a simple way to navigate to a stock and study its price movements. Other features are a footnote to this.
