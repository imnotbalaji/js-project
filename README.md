Background: 
My project is meant as a stock market visualizer for complete beginners.  It is meant to provide a simple way to allow the users to visualize key market data e.g. search for a stock price and look at its performance over time, similarly look at a time period and see a comparative performance of the stocks during that time period.


In the project, my primary features are as follows
    - search for a market equity and look at its performance trend over time.
        - Be able to choose the time period
    - Look at the entire market or a sub-selection of the market as a heatmap of performance - choose any time period of intereest
